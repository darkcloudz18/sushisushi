In the event of any inconsistency between the provision of this Privacy Policy and those other disclosures, the other disclosures will apply.</p>

            <p>This Privacy Policy applies to Sushi Sushi controlled information and Websites, but not to other websites to which our Website may be linked.

            <h3>Your Consent</h3>

            <p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy,&#8239;Personal Information&#8239;is information or an opinion about you as an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable, whether or not the information or opinion is true and whether or not it is recorded in a material form.</p>

            <h3>What Personal Information Do We Collect From You?</h3>

            <p>Generally, the type of Personal Information initially collected by us includes your name, address, telephone number, email address, whether or not you are 18 and an Australian citizen.</p>

            <p>From our franchisees, we also require company details including ABN and/or ACN, financial information including bank account and credit card details, profit and loss statements, balance sheets, weekly takings information, sales data and other business related information which may contain Personal Information.</p>

As a franchisee, your photo may be used within Sushi Sushi to identify you.</p>

            <p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) may be installed in any of our premises.

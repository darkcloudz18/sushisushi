            <h2>Online Ordering</h2>
            <p>You may place an order for our products online which provides advance notice of the products you wish to order. This is not a delivery service. You must nominate the Sushi Sushi store from which you wish to collect your order within the time frame nominated by you when you place your order. At the time of collection, you must provide the credit card with which you paid for the order and proof of identity.</p>

            <p>By allowing you to order online, Sushi Sushi:</p>

            <p>a) may act as agent for a franchised store from which you collect your order;</p>

            <p>b) in its capacity as agent, collects and processes any online payments and remits this amount to the nominated store;</p>

            <p>c) does not (except where you order from a store owned by Sushi Sushi) provide you with any products;</p>

            <p>d) makes no warranties or representations regarding the products to be provided (including availability and delivery); and</p>

            <p>e) reserves the right to alter the agreed price if an incorrect price was caused by a software fault, error or malicious attack.</p>

            <p>By ordering online, you acknowledge that:</p>

            <p>a) all orders are treated as an express intention to purchase the products for the agreed online prices; and</p>

            <p>b) you contract with the nominated store from which you order and not Sushi Sushi (except where you order from a store owned by Sushi Sushi) and therefore you have no claim, recourse or action against Sushi Sushi whatsoever (except where you order from a store owned by Sushi Sushi).</p>

            <h3>Refund Policy</h3>

            <p>Your order will only be prepared when your online payment method has transacted successfully. Once an order has been placed, and your order has been prepared, no refund will be given.</p>
